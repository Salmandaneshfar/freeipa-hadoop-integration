# FreeIPA-Hadoop Integration: Implementation Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a comprehensive integration between FreeIPA identity management and the Hadoop ecosystem services. The goal is to establish secure authentication and authorization mechanisms across all Hadoop components.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1-2)
- [ ] FreeIPA server installation and configuration
- [ ] Hadoop cluster deployment
- [ ] Network configuration for secure communication
- [ ] Initial testing of basic connectivity

### Phase 2: Core Authentication Integration (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Kerberos configuration for FreeIPA
- [ ] HDFS integration with FreeIPA
- [ ] YARN integration with FreeIPA
- [ ] Testing core service authentication

### Phase 3: Service-Specific Integrations (Week 5-8)
- [ ] Apache Ambari integration
- [ ] Apache Ranger integration
- [ ] Hue integration
- [ ] Impala integration
- [ ] HiveServer2 integration
- [ ] Testing all service authentications

### Phase 4: Authorization and Policy Implementation (Week 9-10)
- [ ] Configure role-based access control in FreeIPA
- [ ] Define service-specific authorization policies
- [ ] Implement Apache Ranger policies
- [ ] Testing authorization across services

### Phase 5: User Management Automation (Week 11-12)
- [ ] User provisioning scripts and workflows
- [ ] Group management automation
- [ ] Directory synchronization setup
- [ ] Testing user lifecycle management

### Phase 6: Testing and Documentation (Week 13-14)
- [ ] End-to-end integration testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Complete documentation and handover

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Kerberos configuration issues | High | Medium | Thorough testing of each principal and keytab |
| Service compatibility problems | Medium | Medium | Verify version compatibility matrix prior to integration |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Regular performance testing during implementation |
| User synchronization delays | Low | Medium | Implement real-time sync mechanisms |

## Success Criteria

1. All users can authenticate to Hadoop services using FreeIPA credentials
2. Role-based access control is functioning correctly across all services
3. User management operations in FreeIPA propagate correctly to Hadoop services
4. Security audit logs are properly captured and centralized
5. System performance meets established benchmarks
